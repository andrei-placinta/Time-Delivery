# Time-Delivery
* <i>Developed a C‑based delivery management system with a command‑line interface for adding, editing, tracking, and time‑based scheduling of orders.</i></br>
* <i>Implemented dynamic memory, file I/O, and custom sorting algorithms to simulate real‑time courier workflows with clean, structured code and persistent data handling.</i>

Time delivery was developed as part of a systems programming assignment focused on building real-world logic using the C programming language and a command-line interface. The goal was to simulate a simplified courier delivery management system, emphasizing fundamental concepts without relying on external libraries or graphical interfaces.

The application supports order creation, modification, deletion, sorting by delivery time or ID, and persistent storage through file I/O. It leverages dynamic memory allocation, modular design, and custom sorting algorithms to ensure scalability and clarity. All core operations were implemented manually to strengthen understanding of low-level operations such as pointer manipulation, structured data management, and file handling in C.

This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement functional systems with efficient, maintainable C code suitable for environments where performance and control are critical.
